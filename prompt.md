- **Current Station Highlight:** Highlight the user's current station in real-time using GPS data.
- **Simulation Mode:** Start in simulation mode with faster movement (e.g., one minute between stations) and allow switching to real-time GPS tracking.

### Audio Experience
- **Soundtrack Playback:** Play a placeholder audio file (e.g., [convenience store - shabu shabu - please be careful](https://github.com/pollinations/ula-yamanote.tokyo/raw/refs/heads/main/convenience%20store%20-%20shabu%20shabu%20-%20please%20be%20careful.mp3)) with plans to add multiple station sounds.

## Technical Requirements
- **GPS Integration:** Implement GPS tracking to determine user location and movement speed.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the website is fully responsive and functions seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize visual and audio elements for smooth performance and minimal load times.

## Additional Elements
- **Encouragement to Connect:** Highlight the benefits of connecting with others, especially in the last carriage, to foster a community experience.
