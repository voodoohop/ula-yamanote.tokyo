it is a psychedelic train visualizer of the yamanote line for a gps-triggered music experience. retro and 8-bit and mysterious and japan game themed it should show a visualization of the train and have a locator for the persons location in the train. it should show multiple carriages
please add a glitchy retro announcement that ula yamanote will be launched at traffic club tokyo in roppongi on the 7th of december.
give it a strong japanese style and feeling
there also should be a map of the line which visualizes the current station the user is on using the gps tracking.
the speed of the location tracking should be used to decide whether the train is driving or standing still and show that.
the website should encourage the users to listen to the soundtrack in the last carriage although all carriages are possible to listen. to meet others last carriage is recommended. and if they want to meet other listeners to potentially turn their light on their phone on
maybe the map could have the shape of the yamanote line. following the natural curves slightly
no multi-user visualization for now.
start in a simulation mode that doesnt use gps but allow switching to real mode. it shouold simulate speed and movement maybe a bit faster like one minute between stations

play this audio file: https://github.com/pollinations/ula-yamanote.tokyo/raw/refs/heads/main/convenience%20store%20-%20shabu%20shabu%20-%20please%20be%20careful.mp3 - it is a placeholder for the multiple station sounds later

please also make a button or something yamanote themed that triggers playback. 

add a minimal compass that shows the user's heading and the direction to the nearest station. if the device does not support the heading property, don't show the compass. the compass should show once gps is activated only.

implement a distance-based beep sound that mimics a parking car, with slower beeps as the user moves further from the station.
